My name is Allistair Cota. I am a Mechanical Engineer turned Data Scientist, having recently graduated from the Data Science Diploma program at BrainStation. Previously, I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer at Husky Injection Molding for 4 years, and have experience in solving complex technical problems and contributing to successful product launches. The highlight of my Data Science Diploma was my capstone project that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to predict restaurant rating reviews.

I am proficient in Python, R, and MATLAB programming languages, data processing with SQL, data visualization with Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express. I am well-versed with Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch, and machine learning models. I am also familiar with big data tools such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and working within the AWS environment. I am currently seeking employment as a Data Scientist.

Aside from my fascination with data science and engineering, my passions include music and Formula One. Iâ€™ve played piano ever since I was a child, participated in piano competitions and received the ATCL Performance Diploma in Piano from Trinity College London when I was in high school. Now I also experiment with synthesizers, organs and other keyboard sounds in my spare time. Music channels my inner creativity, discipline, and organization ability, something that I strive to channel in everything I do. Regarding Formula One, I rarely miss watching a race, and I find that this adrenaline-fuelled sport with its intersection of engineering and data science serves as a reminder of how leveraging data can help an individual, organization or community to stay ahead of the curve.
