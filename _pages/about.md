My name is Allistair Cota. I am a Mechanical Engineer turned Data Scientist, having recently graduated from the Data Science Diploma program at BrainStation. Previously, I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer at Husky Injection Molding for 4 years, and have experience in solving complex technical problems and contributing to successful product launches. The highlight of my Data Science Diploma was my capstone project that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to predict restaurant rating reviews.

I am proficient in Python, R, and MATLAB programming languages, data processing with SQL, data visualization with Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express. I am well-versed with Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch, and machine learning models. I am also familiar with big data tools such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and working within the AWS environment. I am currently seeking employment as a Data Scientist.
